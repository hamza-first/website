         It was delivered during a period of escalating tensions between East Pakistan and the powerful political and military establishment of West Pakistan, this was filmed by the actor. In the speech, Rahman proclaimed:
          <strong>"This time the struggle is for our</strong>.This time the struggle is for our independence." He announced a civil disobedience movement in the province, calling for "every house to turn into a fortress".
           <b><i>The speech inspired the Bengali</i></b> people to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilisation by West Pakistan.
            The Bangladesh Liberation War began 18 days later when the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, intelligentsia, students, politicians, and armed personnel.
         On 30 October 2017, UNESCO added the speech in the Memory of the World Register as a documentary heritage.[1][2]</p>
